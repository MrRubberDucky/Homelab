## Podman Quadlet directory

Includes ready `.container`, `.network` and `.pod` deployments of various services.

## Directory explanations

- `Leftovers` are projects I ended up abandoning but left up the Quadlet file for them anyways in case I ever want to try them again.
- `[Core] WAN` has every quadlet deployment of everything that's currently hosted publicy on https://rubberverse.xyz and anything here is treated as 'Core of the infrastructure'.
- `[Core] LAN` same as above but it's for LAN, so stuff for my family etc.
- `WAN` is a mix-mash of everything, like some spin up RSS readers and so on.
- `LAN` ditto as above.
