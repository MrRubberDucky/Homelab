# ================================
# Garbage, useless, downright shit list of websites that pollute search results and abuse SEO to always appear at the top.
# Criteria for adding domains is as following:
# - Text was generated using an LLM
# - Core article art, or it's sub-art was generated with the help of Image Generation technology
# - Intensive ad banner spamming to the point where every small sub-string of text there's an ad
# - Copy 'n' paste templates, ToC (Table of Contents) and other similarities that are known to be abused by generative models
# - Utterly low effort, incoherent or potentially malicious advice given
